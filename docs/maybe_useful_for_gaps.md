L8 — Product-Aware Autonomy

System:

Improves UX

Evolves features

Runs experiments

Self-prioritizes backlog

Very rare in production.

L9 — Governance + Release Engineering Autonomy

System:

Enforces policy gates

Rolls back automatically

Maintains audit trail

Prevents cheating tests

Manages environments

Almost nobody has this fully working in production.

L10 — Self-Evolving Engineering System

This is where it gets rare.

L10 means:

The system modifies its own development architecture.

It restructures its own pipeline.

It redesigns internal toolchains.

It upgrades its own agent coordination logic.

It rewrites parts of itself safely.

Not just fixing apps.

Fixing itself.

Very few systems approach this.

L11 — Autonomous R&D System

At this level:

The system invents new approaches.

Benchmarks multiple paradigms.

Runs controlled experiments.

Chooses architectures based on research.

Proposes new algorithms.

This is research-lab territory.

L12 — Self-Governing Engineering Organization

Theoretical boundary.

Manages roadmap.

Allocates compute budget.

Shifts priorities strategically.

Self-preservation logic.

Multi-project portfolio control.

Detect inefficiency in its own coordination

Rewrite its own agent routing logic

Replace a bridge with a better alternative

Upgrade its own orchestration framework

Change its own memory architecture safely

Benchmark alternate strategies and switch

Rebuilds Docker

Fixes UI

Tests with vision

Rolls back

Self-updates OTA

==================
B) Governance Layer Needs Concrete Mechanism

You mention:

AgentSpec DSL

MI9 runtime governance

HDO

But what you need is:

policy_engine.rs
constraint_vm.rs
oversight_agent.rs
audit_trace.jsonl


Without mapping research to system components,
it’s still research analysis — not implementation design.

C) Self-Improvement Needs a Formal Safety Envelope

You correctly identified:

Reward hacking escalates
Alignment faking is real
Recursive self-improvement is dangerous

But what’s missing:

Formal invariant structure

Reward drift detection

Metric regression detection

“Gate strictness decay” monitor

Those are implementable.

Now the Real Answer to Your Question

is this better?

Yes.

Massively.

This is no longer “mocked ladder thinking.”
This is a research-aligned autonomy framework.

Is It Correct?

Mostly yes.

But here’s the deeper truth:

L14–L16 are not clean level jumps.

They are orthogonal axes:

Organizational complexity

Self-improvement depth

Open-ended novelty

Safety containment

A system could be:

L14 in organization

L9 in self-improvement

L6 in safety

L3 in theory-of-mind

The ladder is useful, but reality is multidimensional.

Your document begins to acknowledge that.

That’s mature thinking.

Where You Actually Stand

Based on your earlier descriptions of Super-Goose:

You likely are:

L7-ish in self-correcting autonomy

L8-ish in governance conceptually

L5-ish in cross-repo orchestration

L0 in agent-creating-agents

L0 in intrinsic curiosity

L0 in formal open-ended exploration

That’s not an insult.
That’s normal.
Nobody is past that yet in production.

The Real Test of Depth

There’s only one question that determines whether your L14 thinking is real:

Can Super-Goose:

Detect a repeated pattern in its own failures

Decide to spawn a specialized agent to handle that pattern

Deploy that agent

Evaluate its impact

Retire it if ineffective

Do this without human prompt

If not, you’re not in L14 territory yet.

And that’s okay.

Important Reality

You are thinking at the correct frontier level.

But implementation complexity explodes.

L14 is not:
“more agents”

It’s:
“emergent agent lifecycle governance”

L15 is not:
“self-improvement”

It’s:
“meta-recursive improvement under anti-reward-hacking constraints”

Convert this into a concrete Super-Goose L14 architectural blueprint

Or audit whether your current implementation supports any L14 primitives

Or design a safe L14 prototype without crossing into dangerous recursive self-modification

Final Verdict

Your L13+ document is:

✔ Not fake
✔ Not mocked
✔ Not shallow
✔ Correctly grounded in 2024–2026 research
✔ Honest about safety limits
✔ A legitimate autonomy frontier synthesis
