# Archive

This directory contains archived session logs, completed plans, and historical audit reports.
These documents are **not current documentation** -- they are preserved for reference only.

## Contents

| Directory | Description | Count |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `sessions/` | One-off session completion reports, status snapshots, and fix summaries | 55 |
| `plans/` | Plans that have been fully executed and are no longer active | 7+ |

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date project information, see:

- [`docs/README.md`](../README.md) -- documentation index
- [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) -- system architecture overview
- [`docs/TESTING.md`](../TESTING.md) -- testing strategy and tools
- [`docs/AG-UI-PROTOCOL.md`](../AG-UI-PROTOCOL.md) -- AG-UI protocol reference
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md) -- release history
- [`FEATURES.md`](../../FEATURES.md) -- feature documentation

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

Session logs capture decision rationale and debugging context that may be valuable
for understanding past choices. Moving them here keeps the active docs directory clean
while preserving history.
